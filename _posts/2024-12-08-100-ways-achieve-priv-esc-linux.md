100 ways to achieve privilege escalation in Linux

Privilege escalation in a Linux environment can be achieved through a variety of methods, often depending on misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or unintended behaviors in the system. Hereâ€™s a list of **100 potential ways** to escalate privileges from a non-root user to a root user. These are categorized into common areas like misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, binaries, and kernel exploits.

---

### **1-20: Misconfigurations**
1. World-writable files in sensitive directories like `/etc/`.
2. Misconfigured `sudo` privileges allowing execution of unintended binaries.
3. Misconfigured `setuid` binaries owned by root.
4. Writable `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`.
5. Writable `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
6. Cron jobs running as root with writable scripts.
7. Writable `/var/spool/cron/` directory.
8. Root-owned files with improper ACL permissions.
9. Sticky-bit misconfigurations on sensitive directories.
10. Writable scripts executed by services running as root.
11. SSH keys in `/root/.ssh/` with world-readable permissions.
12. World-writable `/var/log/` files.
13. Incorrect permissions on kernel module files.
14. Improper permissions on shared libraries.
15. Misconfigured `capabilities` (e.g., binaries with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`).
16. NFS exports with `no_root_squash` enabled.
17. Improper mount options (`exec` in `/tmp` or `/home`).
18. User writable `/dev` devices.
19. Writable `LD_PRELOAD` directories.
20. `docker` group membership allowing root-level access.

### **21-40: Exploitable Binaries**
21. Exploiting `vi`/`vim` through `sudo` with improper configurations.
22. Exploiting `less` when invoked with `sudo`.
23. Using `awk` to escalate privileges via `sudo`.
24. Using `python` to execute arbitrary code with `sudo`.
25. Exploiting `tar` with `sudo` for arbitrary file writes.
26. Using `find` with `sudo` to execute arbitrary commands.
27. Exploiting `bash` with `sudo` to open a root shell.
28. Using `perl` to execute code with `sudo`.
29. Exploiting `rsync` with root permissions.
30. Using `cp` to overwrite critical files with `sudo`.
31. Exploiting `git` when configured with root access.
32. Using `scp` to overwrite files via `sudo`.
33. Leveraging `zip` or `unzip` for privilege escalation.
34. Exploiting `mysql` to gain code execution.
35. Using `vim` temporary files to escalate privileges.
36. Exploiting `journalctl` with improper configurations.
37. Using `env` with `sudo` for privilege escalation.
38. Misusing `screen` if running with setuid or sudo.
39. Exploiting `tmux` session misconfigurations.
40. Using `node.js` or `node` in `sudo` context.

50. Exploiting `glibc` vulnerabilities.
51. Exploiting `snapd` vulnerabilities.
52. Exploiting `Apache` misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

### **Final Notes**
- Always get permission before testing these techniques (penetration testing or ethical hacking).
- Many methods require specific preconditions like vulnerable software, misconfigurations, or inadequate permissions.
- Keeping your Linux system updated and configured properly can mitigate many of these risks.
