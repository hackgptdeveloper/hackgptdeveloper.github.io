Following up from previous article:

[Generating a simulated dialogue when given a problem](https://hackgptdeveloper.github.io/2025/04/20/dialogue-experiment.html)

Now instead of reading the generated dialogue, the aim is to make it more exciting for learning for the user.   So instead of just generating the normal flow of chatting to probe for more details and generating answer for end-user questions, we will do it the gaming way:   gamify the dialogue process so that end-user will discover the details for themselves instead of information spoon-feeding, and perhaps creating an element of achievements by gaining points for each steps crossed.   Many possibilities of variations exists.   Here are the details.
