### **1. Iterative Development**  
Work is done in small, manageable cycles called iterations or sprints.  

### **2. Incremental Delivery**  
Software is developed and delivered in small, functional increments rather than all at once.  

### **3. Adaptive Planning**  
Plans are continuously revised based on feedback and evolving requirements.  

### **4. Continuous Feedback**  
Regular feedback loops ensure that the product meets user needs.  

### **5. Customer Collaboration**  
Customers and stakeholders are involved throughout the development process.  

### **6. Cross-Functional Teams**  
Teams consist of developers, testers, designers, and business analysts working together.  

### **7. Self-Organizing Teams**  
Teams manage their own workflow and responsibilities without heavy managerial oversight.  

### **8. Prioritized Backlog**  
Features and tasks are organized in a backlog and prioritized based on business value.  

### **9. Emphasis on Working Software**  
Deliverables focus on functional software rather than extensive documentation.  

### **10. Face-to-Face Communication**  
Direct communication (often in daily stand-ups) is preferred over lengthy documentation.  

### **11. Continuous Integration (CI)**  
Code changes are frequently merged, built, and tested to detect issues early.  

### **12. Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
Software is automatically released to production after passing quality checks.  

### **13. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
Tests are written before the code to ensure correctness.  

### **14. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**  
Development is driven by defining system behavior in plain language.  

### **15. Pair Programming**  
Two developers work together at a single workstation for better quality and knowledge sharing.  

### **16. Short Feedback Loops**  
Quick iteration cycles help catch and resolve issues early.  

### **17. Minimal Documentation**  
Documentation is kept lightweight and focused on whatâ€™s necessary.  

### **18. Agile Manifesto Values**  
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

### **19. Scrum Framework**  
A structured Agile methodology with roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Dev Team), events, and artifacts.  

### **20. Kanban Methodology**  
A visual system for managing work with a focus on limiting work in progress (WIP).  

### **21. Lean Principles**  
Eliminate waste, deliver fast, and continuously improve.  

### **22. Story Points for Estimation**  
Relative effort estimation is used instead of exact time estimates.  

### **23. User Stories**  
Features are described in simple, non-technical language from the user's perspective.  

### **24. Acceptance Criteria**  
Each user story has defined criteria that must be met before it is considered complete.  

### **25. Definition of Done (DoD)**  
A checklist of requirements that must be met for work to be considered finished.  

### **26. Burndown and Burnup Charts**  
Visual representations of completed and remaining work.  

### **27. Velocity Measurement**  
A metric used to track team progress and predict future work capacity.  

### **28. Retrospectives**  
Regular meetings where teams reflect on past work and find ways to improve.  

### **29. Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum)**  
Short daily meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and goals.  

### **30. Timeboxing**  
Setting fixed time limits for meetings and tasks to maintain focus.  

### **31. Servant Leadership**  
Leaders support and empower teams rather than micromanage them.  

### **32. Fail Fast, Learn Fast**  
Encourages rapid experimentation and learning from mistakes.  

### **33. Swarming**  
The team collectively focuses on completing high-priority tasks.  

### **34. Spikes**  
Short research or exploration tasks to reduce uncertainty.  

### **35. Technical Debt Awareness**  
Teams prioritize refactoring and improving code quality over time.  

### **36. Refactoring**  
Improving existing code without changing its functionality.  

### **37. Agile Release Planning**  
High-level planning for multiple iterations ahead.  

### **38. Continuous Learning**  
Teams encourage ongoing education and improvement.  

### **39. DevOps Alignment**  
Agile development is closely tied to DevOps practices for faster, more reliable deployments.  

### **40. Collective Code Ownership**  
The entire team shares responsibility for the codebase.  

### **41. Code Reviews**  
Regular peer reviews ensure quality and knowledge sharing.  

### **42. Sustainable Pace**  
Work should be done at a constant, maintainable speed to prevent burnout.  

### **43. Value-Driven Development**  
The highest-value features are developed first.  

### **44. Simplicity**  
The simplest solution that works is preferred.  

### **45. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**  
Plans are flexible and adjusted based on new insights.  

### **46. Frequent Releases**  
Deploying small, frequent releases reduces risk.  

### **47. Transparent Workflow**  
Everyone has visibility into priorities and progress.  

### **48. Automated Testing**  
Tests are automated to speed up verification.  

### **49. Empirical Process Control**  
Decisions are based on observation, experimentation, and adaptation.  

### **50. Business and Development Alignment**  
Development teams work closely with business stakeholders to ensure alignment with goals.
