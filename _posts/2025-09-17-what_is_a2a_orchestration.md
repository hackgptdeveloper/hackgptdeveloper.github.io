Agent-to-Agent (**A2A**) orchestration is where **multiple autonomous agents** collaborate by passing tasks, context, or results to one another. Instead of one monolithic agent, you compose a workflow of specialized agents. This is very relevant to **LangGraph** (or LangChain agents) where you model workflows as **graphs**.

Let me walk you through step-by-step with **sample code**.

# ðŸ”¹ Conceptual Flow

1. **ResearchAgent**

   * Takes a query.
   * Fetches/searches data (stubbed in example).
   * Produces structured output.

2. **SummarizerAgent**

   * Takes research output.
   * Summarizes into digestible text.

3. **ReviewerAgent**

   * Checks the summary for clarity, correctness.
   * Adds final polish.

4. **Orchestrator** (LangGraph / simple Python driver)

   * Connects these agents in sequence.
   * Ensures one agentâ€™s output feeds the next.

# ðŸ”¹ Minimal Python Example (LangGraph)

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# --- Define Agents ---
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

def research_agent(state):
    query = state["query"]
    return {
        "research": f"Stub: Collected 3 facts about '{query}'."
    }

def summarizer_agent(state):
    research = state["research"]
    response = llm.invoke(f"Summarize this research: {research}")
    return {"summary": response.content}

def reviewer_agent(state):
    summary = state["summary"]
    response = llm.invoke(f"Review and polish this summary: {summary}")
    return {"final": response.content}

# --- Build Orchestration Graph ---
workflow = StateGraph(dict)

workflow.add_node("research", research_agent)
workflow.add_node("summarizer", summarizer_agent)
workflow.add_node("reviewer", reviewer_agent)

workflow.set_entry_point("research")
workflow.add_edge("research", "summarizer")
workflow.add_edge("summarizer", "reviewer")
workflow.add_edge("reviewer", END)

graph = workflow.compile()

# --- Run Example ---
result = graph.invoke({"query": "Quantum computing in education"})
print(result["final"])
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ How Orchestration Happens (Step-by-Step)

* **State Management**:
  Each agent updates the shared `state` dict. This makes hand-off explicit.
  (LangGraph automatically manages this shared state).

* **Directed Graph**:
  `workflow.add_edge("A", "B")` defines Aâ†’B flow.
  Agents only need to know their inputs/outputs, not each other.

* **LLM + Function Nodes**:
  Some nodes use **LLM calls** (`ChatOpenAI`), others can be deterministic code (`research_agent`).

---

# ðŸ”¹ Why This Is A2A Orchestration

* **Autonomy**: Each agent is independent, doesnâ€™t know who comes next.
* **Orchestration**: The **graph** coordinates their execution.
* **Composable**: Swap out `SummarizerAgent` for another summarizer without touching orchestration logic.
