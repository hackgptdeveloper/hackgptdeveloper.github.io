Here’s a structured list of **50 auditing rules** for AI workflow automation, covering governance, compliance, technical integrity, and operational safety. I’ve grouped them into domains for clarity.

---

## 1. Governance & Compliance

1. Verify the workflow aligns with organizational AI governance policies.
2. Ensure all automation steps comply with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
3. Check that model usage respects licensing and open-source obligations.
4. Confirm that data processing agreements (DPAs) are in place for third-party integrations.
5. Audit adherence to industry standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 42001 for AI management systems).
6. Validate that workflow changes are subject to approval through change management.
7. Ensure automated decision systems provide human-in-the-loop options where required.
8. Confirm bias and fairness assessments are logged and reviewed.
9. Verify that audit logs are immutable and tamper-proof.
10. Ensure ethical AI principles (transparency, accountability) are explicitly documented.

## 2. Data Integrity & Privacy

11. Verify input datasets are validated, cleansed, and version-controlled.
12. Ensure PII/PHI is anonymized or encrypted before processing.
13. Confirm retention policies are enforced for intermediate and output data.
14. Audit data lineage from ingestion → preprocessing → output.
15. Check that sensitive data isn’t exported to non-authorized services.
16. Ensure secrets (API keys, OAuth tokens) are stored in secure vaults.
17. Verify compliance with data minimization principles.
18. Test whether unauthorized modifications of input data trigger alerts.
19. Confirm that access to training/serving datasets is role-based.
20. Ensure reproducibility of data splits used in model training.

## 3. Workflow Logic & Control

21. Verify workflows implement error handling for failed API calls.
22. Ensure retries/backoff policies are implemented to prevent cascading failures.
23. Audit conditional branching logic for unintended bypasses.
24. Confirm deterministic workflows where determinism is required (e.g., auditing pipelines).
25. Ensure workflows enforce rate limiting for external APIs.
26. Verify loops and recursion have termination checks.
27. Audit scheduling (cron/trigger) to prevent excessive execution.
28. Ensure that escalation paths exist for stuck workflows.
29. Validate that rollback/compensation logic exists for partial failures.
30. Check workflow isolation: one automation should not impact another without control.

---

## 4. Security Controls

31. Ensure workflows authenticate against services with least privilege.
32. Verify transport encryption (TLS/HTTPS) for all external connections.
33. Confirm that stored outputs are encrypted at rest.
34. Ensure identity propagation (OAuth, JWT) is verified and logged.
35. Audit integrations for possible SSRF or injection attacks.
36. Verify rate limits against brute-force or DDoS via automation triggers.
37. Confirm sandboxing of untrusted model outputs (e.g., generated code).
38. Audit workflows for hardcoded credentials or tokens.
39. Ensure anomaly detection exists for unusual workflow execution patterns.
40. Verify auditability of access to workflow definitions and configurations.

## 5. Model & AI-Specific Checks

41. Validate that models used in automation have passed fairness/robustness tests.
42. Confirm inference outputs are validated before being consumed downstream.
43. Ensure fallback logic exists for low-confidence AI responses.
44. Audit model versioning in the workflow for traceability.
45. Verify retraining triggers (data drift, concept drift) are logged and approved.
46. Ensure explainability metadata (e.g., SHAP, LIME outputs) is captured for review.
47. Confirm that workflow doesn’t propagate hallucinations into critical systems.
48. Audit prompt templates for injection vulnerabilities.
49. Verify red-teaming/adversarial testing was performed on workflow AI components.
50. Ensure continuous monitoring of AI outputs for bias, toxicity, or harmful actions.

✅ These 50 rules create a **baseline auditing checklist** for AI workflow automation across governance, data, logic, security, and AI-specific dimensions.
