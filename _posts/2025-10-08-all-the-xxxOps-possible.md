Yes ‚Äî **many** other *‚ÄúOps‚Äù* paradigms exist today, each targeting a different intersection of disciplines ‚Äî extending from **DevOps** (Dev + Ops) into **security, finance, AI, ML, data, networking, compliance**, and even **business process** management.

Below is a **comprehensive taxonomy** of `*-Ops` variations grouped by domain, with **low-level explanation of scope**, **key automation/tooling areas**, and **source-level origins** (where the concept evolved from in the DevOps ecosystem).

* **Infrastructure as Code** ‚Üí 1st code-level implementations:

  * Puppet (Ruby DSL, 2005) ‚Üí `Puppet::Type.newtype(:package)` DSL core.
  * Chef (Ruby DSL, 2008) ‚Üí `Chef::Resource::Package` class.
  * Terraform (Go, 2014) ‚Üí `internal/lang/eval.go` interpreter for HCL configs.
* **Security-as-Code (DevSecOps)** ‚Üí emerged from HashiCorp Vault and OPA‚Äôs Rego policy engine (`ast/compile.go`, Rego parser).
* **FinOps** ‚Üí Python-based cost analyzers in Kubecost and CloudHealth originated from Kubernetes metrics API (`pkg/kubelet/apis/stats/v1alpha1/types.go`).
