Here are 30 concise characteristics commonly associated with **agentic** AI systems, especially agentic LLMs:

1. Autonomy in decision-making and task execution with minimal human supervision. [ibm](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai)
2. Ability to interpret high-level goals and translate them into concrete plans. [uc](https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2025/06/what-is-agentic-ai-definition-and-2025-guide.html)
3. Multi-step **planning** to break complex objectives into sub-tasks and sequences of actions. [blogs.nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/)
4. Context-aware reasoning over heterogeneous inputs (text, tools, state, environment). [workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html)
5. Dynamic re-planning when conditions, data, or constraints change during execution. [blogs.nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/)
6. Direct action-taking capability on external systems (APIs, applications, workflows, UIs) rather than only generating text. [datasciencedojo](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/agentic-llm-in-2025/)
7. Tool usage: selecting and invoking tools like web search, code execution, or domain APIs as part of problem solving. [emergentmind](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/llm-agents-making-agent-tools)
8. Tool discovery and self-configuration (finding, wiring, or generating new tools/wrappers when needed). [emergentmind](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/llm-agents-making-agent-tools)
9. Ability to monitor external systems and trigger actions based on real-time signals or events. [aerospike](https://aerospike.com/blog/agentic-ai-explained/)
10. Support for long-term and short-term memory to store past interactions, intermediate results, and environment state. [codiste](https://www.codiste.com/building-autonomous-systems-with-agentic-llms)
11. Learning from outcomes (success/failure) to refine future strategies and behaviors over time. [aerospike](https://aerospike.com/blog/agentic-ai-explained/)
12. Self-correction via retries, backtracking, or alternative strategies when a chosen plan fails. [datasciencedojo](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/agentic-llm-in-2025/)
13. Coordination of multiple specialized sub-agents, often with different roles or tools. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13946)
14. Orchestration logic to route tasks between agents and consolidate their outputs into a coherent result. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13946v1)
15. Goal-driven behavior where actions are evaluated against explicit objectives and constraints. [ibm](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai)
16. Ability to prioritize tasks or actions based on impact, urgency, or resource limits. [exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/agentic-ai/agentic-ai-tools-key-capabilities-and-7-tools-to-know/)
17. Operating robustly in partially observable, uncertain, or noisy environments using probabilistic reasoning. [exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/agentic-ai/agentic-ai-tools-key-capabilities-and-7-tools-to-know/)
18. Handling complex, multi-step business or operational workflows end to end (e.g., logistics, IT incidents). [workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html)
19. Maintaining an internal state or working memory across steps in a session or workflow. [codiste](https://www.codiste.com/building-autonomous-systems-with-agentic-llms)
20. Supporting iterative refinement: draft → critique → improve cycles, sometimes via multi-agent debate or review. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13946)
21. Hallucination mitigation strategies such as cross-checking between agents or explicit validation stages. [papers.ssrn](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5086241)
22. Transparent reasoning traces or structured messages (e.g., JSON, meta-information) to improve interpretability. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13946v1)
23. Policy- and guardrail-aware behavior, respecting safety, compliance, or business rules while acting. [ibm](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai)
24. Ability to generalize to new tasks within a domain without explicit reprogramming, using foundation models plus tools. [workday](https://www.workday.com/en-sg/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html)
25. Continuous operation over time (agent “runs” or daemons) rather than single-turn request/response interactions. [exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/agentic-ai/agentic-ai-tools-key-capabilities-and-7-tools-to-know/)
26. Integration with enterprise data sources and applications to ground decisions in up-to-date information. [aws.amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/agentic-ai/)
27. Human-in-the-loop support where the agent can escalate, request clarification, or seek approval at key decision points. [workday](https://www.workday.com/en-sg/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html)
28. Personalization or adaptation to specific users, roles, or organizations based on historical interaction patterns. [aws.amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/agentic-ai/)
29. Performance and efficiency awareness, e.g., choosing cheaper/faster actions or batching work where possible. [datasciencedojo](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/agentic-llm-in-2025/)
30. Modular, composable architecture where agents, tools, and policies can be combined into larger multi-agent systems. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13946)
