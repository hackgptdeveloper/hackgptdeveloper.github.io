When designing a cloud system, you need **two categories of monitoring and defense**:

1. **Performance Monitoring** (CPU, memory, latency, throughput, scaling issues).
2. **Security Monitoring** (detecting intrusions, vulnerabilities, abnormal behaviors).

Here are **10 tools** that cover both aspects:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Performance & Reliability Monitoring

1. **Prometheus + Grafana**

   * Prometheus scrapes metrics (e.g., Kubernetes pods, VM stats).
   * Grafana visualizes them in dashboards with alerts (CPU spikes, latency).
   * Source: [Prometheus GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus).

2. **Datadog**

   * SaaS monitoring for infrastructure, applications, logs, and cloud-native services.
   * Detects anomalies with AI-based alerting.
   * Integrates with AWS, GCP, Azure.

3. **AWS CloudWatch / GCP Cloud Monitoring / Azure Monitor**

   * Native cloud performance monitoring.
   * Collects logs, metrics, traces, and sets alarms for autoscaling or incidents.

4. **New Relic**

   * Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with distributed tracing.
   * Useful for microservices and serverless architectures.

5. **Elastic Observability (ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats)**

   * Collects, stores, and analyzes logs/metrics.
   * Can integrate with SIEM for threat detection.

## ðŸ”¹ Security & Vulnerability Detection

6. **Wazuh (Open Source SIEM/XDR)**

   * Detects intrusions, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues.
   * File integrity monitoring, log analysis, malware detection.
   * Source: [Wazuh GitHub](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh).

7. **Snort / Suricata (IDS/IPS)**

   * Network-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention.
   * Signatures + anomaly-based detection to catch infiltration.
   * Suricata adds multi-threading and deep packet inspection.

8. **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools like Prisma Cloud (Palo Alto)**

   * Continuously scans cloud configs for misconfigurations (open S3 buckets, weak IAM roles).
   * Detects compliance drift (CIS, NIST, SOC2).

9. **Aqua Security / Falco**

   * Runtime protection for containers & Kubernetes.
   * Falco monitors syscalls for suspicious behavior (crypto-mining, privilege escalation).
   * Source: [Falco GitHub](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco).

10. **CrowdStrike Falcon / SentinelOne / Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

* Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) extended to cloud workloads.
* Detects malware, ransomware, lateral movement inside the cloud.

âœ… **Combined Architecture**:

* **Performance side**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK or Datadog.
* **Security side**: Wazuh (SIEM) + Falco (runtime) + Suricata/Snort (network IDS).
* **Cloud-native posture**: Prisma Cloud or Defender for Cloud to catch misconfigurations.
