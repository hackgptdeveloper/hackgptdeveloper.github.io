title: "Using Groq to build AI agents framework"

**Groq** primarily provides high-performance hardware for AI workloads and does not come with a specific proprietary AI agent framework. However, Groq's ecosystem is designed to work seamlessly with widely-used AI frameworks, enabling the creation and deployment of AI agents by leveraging these existing tools. 

Hereâ€™s how Groq integrates and supports AI frameworks:

---

### 1. **Supported AI Frameworks**
Groq hardware is compatible with:
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**: The most critical format for Groq deployments as models are often converted to ONNX for compilation.

Groq does not have a specific "AI agent framework" like LangChain, but its hardware accelerates the inference and processing of models developed in these frameworks.

---

### 2. **Integration with AI Agent Frameworks**
For building full AI agents, Groq hardware can work with the following frameworks:
- **LangChain**: A framework for building LLM-based agents. Groq hardware can serve the LLM inference component, while LangChain manages orchestration and tool usage.
- **Ray**: For distributed AI tasks, where Groq accelerators are used to process tasks requiring neural network computations.
- **Hugging Face**: Groq supports models from Hugging Face Transformers, enabling quick deployment of conversational and decision-making agents.

---

### 3. **Groq-Specific Development Tools**
Groq provides its own tools to facilitate model deployment, which can be part of an AI agent pipeline:
- **Groq Compiler**: Converts models (usually from ONNX) into Groq-compatible binaries.
- **Groq Runtime**: A Python API for deploying and running compiled models on Groq hardware.
- **Groq API**: Provides low-level control for deploying and managing AI workloads on Groq chips.

These tools act as the backend for computational tasks but do not manage agent-specific logic.

---

### 4. **How Groq Fits into an AI Agent Framework**
Groq accelerates the inference part of the AI agent, which includes:
1. **Input Processing**:
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP).
   - Image or video preprocessing.
2. **Decision-Making**:
   - Neural network inference, such as transformers, reinforcement learning policies, or deep Q-networks.
3. **Output Generation**:
   - LLM responses, action commands, or predictions.

### 5. **Example Workflow**
If you use Groq with a framework like LangChain, the workflow might look like this:
1. Train or fine-tune a model in **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**.
2. Export the model to ONNX format.
3. Use the **Groq Compiler** to convert the ONNX model to a Groq-optimized binary.
4. Deploy the model on Groq hardware using the **Groq Runtime**.
5. Use LangChain or a similar orchestration framework to manage the interaction logic of your AI agent.

### Summary
While Groq does not have its own AI agent framework, it integrates into existing AI ecosystems by providing high-performance processing for AI models. Developers typically use frameworks like LangChain, Ray, or Hugging Face for the agent logic while leveraging Groq hardware for model inference acceleration.
