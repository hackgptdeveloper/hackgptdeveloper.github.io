Rotating IPs refers to the practice of changing the IP address used by a client or server periodically or per request. This technique is used in a variety of domains, and it has **security**, **anonymity**, **rate-limiting evasion**, and **load balancing** implications. Below is a breakdown of the purpose, use cases, and technical underpinnings of IP rotation:

### üîß **Purpose of Rotating IPs**

1. **Avoiding Rate Limits and Bans**
   - Web services (e.g., APIs, websites) often rate-limit clients based on their IP addresses.
   - Rotating IPs allows clients (like web scrapers) to distribute requests across multiple IPs to avoid detection or throttling.

2. **Evading IP-based Blocking**
   - Some services block IPs based on geographic location, blacklists, or behavior patterns.
   - Rotating to fresh or whitelisted IPs allows access despite these blocks.

3. **Enhancing Anonymity**
   - Tor and other anonymity networks rotate IPs to prevent tracking.
   - This makes it harder for adversaries to correlate actions with specific users.

4. **Load Distribution**
   - In proxy services, rotating IPs helps distribute load evenly across a network of servers.

5. **Geolocation Spoofing**
   - Access content restricted to specific geographic regions (e.g., video streaming services).

### üß† **Where Are Rotating IPs Used?**

#### 1. **Web Scraping / Automation**
- Tools like Scrapy, Puppeteer, Selenium use rotating proxies to simulate organic user traffic.
- IPs can be rotated per request, per session, or based on response behavior.

#### 2. **Anonymity Networks**
- **Tor Network**: Uses onion routing where circuits (IP paths) are rotated periodically.
    - Source code reference: [`src/core/or/circuitbuild.c`](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/core/or/circuitbuild.c)
    - Circuit rotation is driven by `newnym` signals or timeouts (~10 minutes).
  
#### 3. **Penetration Testing / Red Teaming**
- When performing scanning or brute-force attempts, rotating IPs can avoid early detection or bans.
- Tools like `ProxyChains`, `Hydra`, or custom scripts rotate IPs using SOCKS5/HTTP proxy pools.

#### 4. **VPN / Proxy Providers**
- Commercial services provide IP rotation:
    - **Residential Proxies**: IPs assigned by ISPs, harder to detect as proxies.
    - **Datacenter Proxies**: Cheaper, more likely to be blacklisted.

#### 5. **Marketing / SEO Tools**
- Rotating IPs allows mass form submissions, ad verifications, or search engine scraping without bans.

#### 6. **Cybercrime / Botnets**
- Malicious actors use IP rotation to evade detection during credential stuffing, click fraud, or phishing.

### üî¨ **Technical Mechanisms**

#### üß© 1. **Proxy Rotation (SOCKS/HTTP)**
- Proxy lists loaded into applications or system-wide proxy settings.
- Rotation policies:
  - Time-based (rotate every N seconds)
  - Request-based (rotate every N requests)
  - Trigger-based (rotate on error or CAPTCHA)

#### üß© 2. **NAT Gateways / IP Pools (Cloud-level)**
- AWS, GCP, and Azure allow assigning Elastic IPs or use NAT Gateways with IP pools.
- Programmatically cycle through allocated IPs.

```bash
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id i-xxxx --allocation-id eipalloc-xxxx
```

#### üß© 3. **Custom IP Tunneling or SDN**
- Using GRE/IPsec tunnels with remote exit nodes.
- Orchestration via SDN controller to rotate external routes.

#### üß© 4. **Tor Circuits**
- Internally, Tor circuits are built using three hops: guard ‚Üí middle ‚Üí exit.
- When circuit rotation is triggered, a new path is selected from available nodes.

```c
/* Simplified Tor code excerpt */
circuit_t *circuit_launch(uint8_t purpose) {
    /* pick nodes */
    build_circuit_path(&path);
    ...
    send_create_cell(&path);
}
```

#### üß© 5. **Docker/Kubernetes with Multiple Interfaces**
- Containers can be spun up with different public IPs using macvlan, CNI plugins, or VPN-based exit.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Detection and Prevention**

Organizations detecting malicious activity from rotating IPs often use:

- **Behavioral analysis**: Not just IP, but request fingerprinting (headers, cookies, timing).
- **Captcha or JS challenges**: Challenge each session regardless of IP.
- **Known proxy IP lists**: Vendors maintain dynamic lists of IPs tied to proxy services.
